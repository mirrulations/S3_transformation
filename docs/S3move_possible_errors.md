# Potential Issues in S3 File Transfer Script & Suggested Fixes

## 1. API Rate Limits & Throttling
- **Risk:** AWS S3 has API rate limits, and using `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=64)` could trigger throttling errors (HTTP 503 Slow Down).
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Reduce `max_workers` to `16` or `32`.  
  - Implement exponential backoff for retries.  
  - Catch `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` with `RequestLimitExceeded`.

## 2. Lack of Error Handling in `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **Risk:** If an exception occurs inside `executor.submit(process_file, bucket_name, file_key)`, the script won’t retry or log the failed file properly.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use `concurrent.futures.as_completed()` to handle failures.  
  - Log failed tasks and retry them later.

## 3. Large File Handling & Memory Usage
- **Risk:** Large files may consume excessive memory or cause timeouts when copied.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Use **S3 Transfer Acceleration**.  
  - Implement **Multipart Upload** for files >5GB.  


## 4. Inefficient `determine_destination()` Regex
- **Risk:** The regex parsing may fail if the file structure doesn’t match the expected format.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Print or log failed regex matches for debugging.  
  - Use a fallback destination for unmatched files.

## 5. Copying and Deleting in One Step
- **Risk:** Copying and deleting back-to-back may lead to data loss if `s3.copy_object` succeeds but `s3.delete_object` fails.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Verify the object exists in the new location before deleting:
    ```python
    copied = s3.head_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=dest_key)
    if copied:
        s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=source_key)
    ```

## 6. Folder Creation Method
- **Risk:** `s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=RAW_DATA_PREFIX)` does not actually create a folder in S3.
- **Mitigation:**  
  - Ensure placeholders like `RAW_DATA_PREFIX + "placeholder.txt"` exist.  
  - Confirm folder presence by listing objects.

---

## Summary of Suggested Fixes if Errors Arise:
- Reduce `max_workers` to `16-32` to prevent throttling.
- Implement exponential backoff and retry logic.
- Use `s3.head_object` to verify successful copy before deletion.
- Add proper logging for failed regex matches.
- Optimize large file handling using **S3 Transfer Acceleration** and **Multipart Upload**.
- Ensure the IAM role has sufficient permissions.
- Modify folder creation to ensure persistence in S3.
