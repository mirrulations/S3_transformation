Poultry establishments that produce at least 1,000 pounds (lbs.) of product per day are currently eligible for verification sampling (81 FR 7289), and FSIS collects four or five samples per month (once per week) from the largest volume establishments to verify establishments are meeting Salmonella performance standards in raw poultry products (81 FR 7285).\n\nThe agency will continue to sample at this general frequency except under the new policy, establishments producing at least 1,000 lbs. per month are eligible for sampling, with those producing 1,000-20,000 lbs./month sampled randomly approximately twice per year.\n\nFSIS intends to incorporate these changes into sampling assignments in Quarter 2 (January \u2013 March) of fiscal year 2025. Most establishments will experience no change in sampling frequency as a result of the new procedures. However, a few establishments producing less than 1,000 lbs. per day that were not previously assigned samples could now receive 1-2 tasks per year. These changes are reflected in the annual sampling plan.\nFSIS is seeking comments on these changes.
