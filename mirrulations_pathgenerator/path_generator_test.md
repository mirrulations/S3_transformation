# PathGenerator Test File Documentation

## Overview
This file contains unit tests for the `PathGenerator` class, which is responsible for generating paths for various types of files (dockets, documents, comments, and attachments) based on a predefined directory structure. The tests use the `moto` library to mock AWS S3 interactions and verify the correctness of the generated paths.

---

## Test File: `path_generator_test.py`

### Description
The test file validates the functionality of the `PathGenerator` class by:
1. Generating paths for different types of JSON files (dockets, documents, comments, and attachments).
2. Uploading the generated paths to a mock S3 bucket.
3. Verifying that the paths are correctly generated and uploaded.

- **`pytest`**: For writing and running unit tests.
- **`boto3`**: AWS SDK for Python, used for interacting with S3.
- **`moto`**: A library for mocking AWS services during testing.
- **`os`**: For environment variable management.
- **`json`**: For handling JSON data.

### Fixtures

#### `aws_credentials`
**Scope**: Function  
**Description**:  
Sets up mock AWS credentials for testing. These credentials are required by `boto3` to interact with the mock S3 service.

**Environment Variables**:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Mock AWS access key.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Mock AWS secret access key.
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`: Mock AWS session token.
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: Mock AWS region.

### Helper Functions

#### `get_test_docket() -> dict`
**Description**:  
Generates a sample JSON object representing a docket.

**Example Output**:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "USTR-2015-0010",
